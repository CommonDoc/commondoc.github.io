Ideas for future projects for or using CommonDoc:

1. A LaTeX backend. This is essential for producing PDFs without actually having
   to write a PDF file directly. The problem is it requires the user to have a
   TeX engine installed.

2. An extension of CommonDoc for representing mathematics. A format-independent
   syntax should be introduced, along with translators that convert it to TeX,
   MathML, et cetera. The CommonDoc macro system could be used to define
   mathematics-specific macros.

3. A wiki system.
